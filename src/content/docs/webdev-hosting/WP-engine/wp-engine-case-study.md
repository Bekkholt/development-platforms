## Introduction

WP Engine is a managed web hosting service, optimized and specialized for Wordpress websites and apps. It is known for it's high quality customer support that is available 24/7, and for being one of the most trusted Wordpress platforms.

## Brief History

WP Engine was founded by Jason Cohen in 2010. He wanted to focus on web hosting specified for Wordpress after he was experiencing issues on his own blog. He had bad speed and his server was crashing when traffic went up as well as no costumer support to reach out to. After only a year in business his company reached $1 million in sales, after solving these problems Cohen had himself back in the day.

In the beginning they mostly worked with blogs, but as Wordpress has kept evolving through the years, so has WP Engine's customers. One of their main goals has been to always accomodate the needs of their customers, wheter it is a blog, shopping site or larger businesses.

Being a company filled with Wordpress advocates, WP Engine has also contributed to Wordpress itself, being a part of the launching of Wordpress 5.0 and creating popular plugins for Wordpress, like Cloudflare Stream (video streaming plugin) and Amazon Polly (text-to-speech plugin).

Today WP Engine is a global success, having several hosting plans to fit all types and sizes of Wordpress websites and their needs, making them fast, scaleable and with top security and support.
